/**
 * Namespaces are a way of grouping together a set of classes and/or functions. They can be used to collate a set of related pieces into a library.
 * 
 * First, you can see we are using the same namespace declaration in multiple files. This is perfectly legal. You could go on to declare classes and functions in this file, and they would be in the elNamespace namespace. This provides another nice way to organize code in a modular fashion. In this case, putting the namespace declaration at the top, and hence putting us into the namespace, means that we can use things declared inside that namespace without a prefix.
 * 
 * Itâ€™s important to note that any class referenced inside a namespace without a fully qualified namespace is assumed to be in the current namespace. However, PHP will look for functions and constants without fully qualified namespaces in the current namespace, but if they are not found, PHP will fall back to looking for them in the global namespace. This is not true of classes.
 * 
  Any code that is not in a declared namespace is considered to be in the global namespace.
